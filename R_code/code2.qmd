measurement_counts <- btb.long %>%
  group_by(occasion) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(!is.na(score)))

measurement_counts
```

### Methods

```{r}
##compare mean models to find best out of that
#looks like there is a treatment difference
#looks like they are parallel 
#looks like small time trend, especially at beginning of trial, then it smooths out
#most likely linear but will check quadratic time trend

#don't need to include treatment bc it is a randomized trial
#24% of data is missing - assume MAR, use multiple imputation
library(mice)
sapply(btb.long, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

btb %>%
  dplyr::select(-id, -drug, -length, -treatment) %>%
  md.pattern()

# missing data is monotone, arising from dropout, use likelihood methods like in class
```

```{r}
##compare different variance structures

                        na.action = na.omit, method="ML", data = btb.long)

##Compound Symmetry
